# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a curated selection of data analytics and machine learning projects developed during my Master's in Data Analytics. The work spans a diverse set of real-world domains and data types: from forecasting, deep learning, and statistical modeling to policy evaluation and environmental data analysis.

All projects are implemented in **Python** or **R**, and reflect a strong focus on data storytelling, reproducibility, and applied techniques in both supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Project Highlights

### üß† Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- **Plant Disease Detection with CNNs**  
  Convolutional Neural Network model for classifying diseased vs. healthy leaves in crops using image data.

- **Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using LSTM**  
  Time series modeling to forecast crypto price movements using Long Short-Term Memory networks.

### üåç Policy & Environment
- **Quantitative Evaluation of Drug Decriminalization in Portugal**  
  Causal inference techniques (e.g., DiD and DiD Regression) to assess the impact of drug policy reform.

- **Air Pollution Analysis in Europe**  
  Geospatial and temporal analysis of European air quality data ‚Äî PM2.5, NO2, and more.

### üöñ Forecasting & Hackathons
- **Taxi Demand Prediction (Hackathon)**  
  Developed a predictive model to estimate operating profit for taxi drivers based on factors like trip distance, fuel cost, route efficiency, and passenger demand patterns.
